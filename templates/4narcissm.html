                <p>Many people seeking to leave such relationships turn to platforms like youtube for guidence, information & validation, 
                    because of these complexities they are going through in their narcissitic relationship. Ofcourse victims of abuse always need 
                    a validation & a shoulder to kneel on & hear to be heard & understood standing in their shoes, which will not be possible through 
                    youtube videos or social media. While these youtube resources can be credibily helpfull for education & initial steps, it is important to 
                    remeember that professional help is always required from a counsellor/therapist like me who can help you take you out from that trauma from the root cause.</p>
                <p>Logically you know what to do but emotionaly you are chronically confussed. You still can't stop thinking about 
                            the good memories & nice things they did once in a while. </p>
